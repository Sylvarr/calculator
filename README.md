## Description

The calculator is a web-based application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It provides basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The JavaScript code includes a `Calculator` class that handles the logic and rendering of the calculator. The HTML and CSS parts take care of the presentation and styling.

### Calculator Class

The `Calculator` class represents a simple calculator and is responsible for initializing the calculator by rendering the HTML elements, injecting the necessary styles, and attaching event listeners to handle user interactions. It also provides utility methods for performing calculations and updating the display.

```javascript
// Example usage
const calculator = new Calculator("#calculator-container");
```

For a more detailed explanation of the `Calculator` class, you can check the source code which includes comprehensive comments.
